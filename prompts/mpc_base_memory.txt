 This is the cost expression of the MPC, where all weights are tuneable:

    model.cost_expr_ext_cost = (
        weight_qn * n**2 + 
        weight_qalpha * alpha**2 + 
        weight_qv * (v - V_target)**2 + 
        weight_qac * der_v**2 + 
        weight_ddelta * derDelta**2 +
        u.T @ R @ u
    )


    Here are the tuneable parameters of cost weights and constraints (STRICTLY ADHERE TO THESE NAMES, DONT INVENT NEW ONES!!!):
    # param: min, max, default # description
    qv 0, 2, 10 # weight for velocity tracking -> minimizes error in velocity tracking of the racing line
    qn 0, 100, 20 # weight for lateral deviation tracking -> minimizes error in lateral deviation tracking of the racing line
    qalpha 0, 100, 7 # weight for heading tracking -> minimizes error in heading error tracking of the racing line
    qac 0, 1, 0.01 # weight for limiting the acceleration -> minimizes the acceleration of the vehicle
    qddelta 0, 100, 0.1 # weight for limiting the steering angle rate -> minimizes the rate of change of the steering angle of the vehicle
    alat_max 0, 20, 10 # maximum lateral acceleration -> constraints the lateral acceleration to be below alat_max
    a_min -20, 0, -5 # minimum acceleration -> constraints the acceleration to be above a_min
    a_max 0, 20, 5 # maximum acceleration -> constraints the acceleration to be below a_max
    v_min -2, 5, 1 # minimum velocity -> constraints the velocity to be above v_min
    v_max -1, 10, 5 # maximum velocity -> constraints the velocity to be below v_max
    track_safety_margin 0, 1.0, 0.45 # inflation of the boundary of the track to increase the safety margin to the track walls
