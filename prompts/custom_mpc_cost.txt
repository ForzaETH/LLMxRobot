This is dummy example of a custom cost function for the MPC. The cost function is defined as a weighted sum of the following terms:

```python

import numpy as np

#cost function
def custom_cost_function(x, u, p):
    # Define parameters and matrix
    weight_n = 100
    weight_alpha = 0
    weight_v = 0
    weight_der_v = 0
    weight_derDelta = 0
    V_target = 1  # Target velocity
    R = np.diag([1, 1])  # Control effort weights

    # Cost expression
    cost_expr = (
        weight_n * x[1]**2 +
        weight_alpha * x[2]**2 +
        weight_v * (x[3] - V_target)**2 +
        weight_der_v * u[0]**2 +
        weight_derDelta * u[1]**2 +
        u.T @ R @ u #It needs the input cost within the cost function
    )
    return cost_expr

#Terminal cost function
def custom_cost_function_e(x, u, p):
    # Define parameters and matrix
    weight_n = 100
    weight_alpha = 0
    weight_v = 0
    weight_der_v = 0
    weight_derDelta = 0
    V_target = 1  # Target velocity

    # Cost expression
    cost_expr = (
        weight_n * x[1]**2 +
        weight_alpha * x[2]**2 +
        weight_v * (x[3] - V_target)**2 +
        weight_der_v * u[0]**2 +
        weight_derDelta * u[1]**2
    )
    return cost_expr
    
```
