# Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.

# Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.

# Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

# Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.

# Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.

# Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

# Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.

# Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.

# Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants. 

# Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.

# Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
